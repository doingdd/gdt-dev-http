[`gdt`][gdt] is a testing library that allows test authors to cleanly describe tests
in a YAML file. `gdt` reads YAML files that describe a test's assertions and
then builds a set of Go structures that the standard Go
[`testing`](https://golang.org/pkg/testing/) package can execute.

[gdt]: https://github.com/gdt-dev/gdt

This `github.com/doingdd/gdt-dev-http` (enhanced version of gdt-http) repository
is a companion Go library for `gdt` that allows test authors to cleanly
describe functional tests of HTTP APIs using a simple, clear YAML format.
`gdt-http` parses YAML files that describe HTTP requests and assertions about
what the HTTP response should contain.

**Enhanced Features:**
- ✅ Custom HTTP headers support
- ✅ All original gdt-http functionality

## Installation

`gdt-http` is a Golang library and is intended to be included in your own Golang
application's test code as a Golang package dependency.

Install `gdt-http` into your `$GOPATH` by executing:

```
go get -u github.com/doingdd/gdt-dev-http
```

## `gdt-http` test file structure

The `gdt-http` test file [parser](parse.go) parses a test file with type
"http". It parses the test file into an object with the following attributes:

* `tests`: list of test unit objects that describe a test of an HTTP request and
  response

Each of the test unit objects have the following attributes:

* `name`: (optional) string describing the individual test. If missing or
  empty, the test unit's name is a string with the request HTTP method and path
* `description`: (optional) string with a longer description of the test unit
* `method`: (optional) string with the HTTP verb to use. Defaults to "GET" if
  `url` attribute is non-empty
* `url`: (optional) string with the path or URL to use for the HTTP request. If
  missing, one of the `GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, `DELETE` or `PUT` shortcut
  attributes must be non-empty
  * `GET`: (optional) string with the path or URL to issue an HTTP GET request
  * `POST`: (optional) string with the path or URL to issue an HTTP POST request
  * `PUT`: (optional) string with the path or URL to issue an HTTP PUT request
  * `PATCH`: (optional) string with the path or URL to issue an HTTP PATCH request
  * `DELETE`: (optional) string with the path or URL to issue an HTTP DELETE request
* `headers`: (optional) map of string to string containing HTTP headers to be
  sent with the request. For example:
  ```yaml
  headers:
    Authorization: Bearer token123
    Content-Type: application/json
    X-Custom-Header: custom-value
  ```
* `data`: (optional) if present, will be encoded into the HTTP request
  payload. Elements of the `data` structure may be JSONPath expressions (see [below](#use-jsonpath-expressions-to-substitute-fixture-data))
* `assert`: (optional) object describing the **assertions** to make about the
  HTTP response received after issuing the HTTP request

The `asssert` object has the following attributes:

* `status`: (optional) integer corresponding to the expected HTTP status code
  of the HTTP response
* `strings`: (optional) list of strings that should appear in the body of the
  HTTP response
* `json`: (optional) object describing the assertions to make about JSON
  content in the HTTP response body

The `json` object has the following attributes:

* `len`: (optional) integer representing the number of bytes in the resulting
  JSON object after successfully parsing the HTTP response body
* `paths`: (optional) map of strings where the keys of the map are JSONPath
  expressions and the values of the map are the expected value to be found when
  evaluating the JSONPath expression
* `path_formats`: (optional) map of strings where the keys of the map are
  JSONPath expressions and the values of the map are the expected format of the
  value to be found when evaluating the JSONPath expression. See the
  [list of valid format strings](#valid-format-strings)
* `schema`: (optional) string containing a filepath to a JSONSchema document.
  If present, the JSON included in the HTTP response will be validated against
  this JSONSChema document.

### Specify HTTP request payload

The `data` attribute of the test unit is used to specify a payload to be
encoded into the HTTP request body. By default, the contents of the `data`
attribute are encoded as JSON.

TODO(jaypipes): Support non-JSON encoding.

The `data` attribute is especially useful for testing of `POST` and `PUT`
requests, where you want to send data to the server to create or update some
resource.

For example, suppose the `POST /books` URL accepts some JSON-encoded data with
information about the to-be-created book's author, title, publisher, etc.

To test the `POST /books` functionality, a test author might use the following
test unit:

```yaml
 - name: create a new book
   POST: /books
   data:
     title: For Whom The Bell Tolls
     published_on: 1940-10-21
     pages: 480
     author_id: "1"
     publisher_id: "1"
   assert:
     status: 201
```

#### Using custom HTTP headers

You can specify custom HTTP headers to be sent with the request using the
`headers` field. This is especially useful for authentication, content type
specification, or any other custom headers your API requires:

```yaml
 - name: create a new book with authentication
   POST: /books
   headers:
     Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9
     Content-Type: application/json
     X-Request-ID: req-12345
   data:
     title: For Whom The Bell Tolls
     published_on: 1940-10-21
     pages: 480
     author_id: "1"
     publisher_id: "1"
   assert:
     status: 201
```

#### Use JSONPath expressions to substitute fixture data

Often, you will want to reference some information in a fixture instead of
hard-coding values in the `data` contents.

Consider this test unit:

```yaml
 - name: create a new book
   POST: /books
   data:
     title: For Whom The Bell Tolls
     published_on: 1940-10-21
     pages: 480
     author_id: "1"
     publisher_id: "1"
   assert:
     status: 201
```

Hard-coding the string `"1"` for the `author_id` and `publisher_id` values is
fragile and non-descriptive. It requires the reader of the test to know which
author has an ID of "1" and which publisher has an ID of "1".

It would be much more readable if we could replace those hard-coded `"1"`
values with a reference to some fixture data:

```yaml
fixtures:
 - books_api
 - books_data
tests:
 - name: create a new book
   POST: /books
   data:
     title: For Whom The Bell Tolls
     published_on: 1940-10-21
     pages: 480
     author_id: $.authors.by_name["Ernest Hemingway"].id
     publisher_id: $.publishers.by_name["Charles Scribner's Sons"].id
   assert:
     status: 201
```

The test reader can now better understand what value is being placed into the
"author_id" field of the HTTP request payload: the ID value of the author whose
name is "Ernest Hemingway".

The JSONPath expressions that replaced the hard-coded `"1"` values are
evaluated by the fixtures associated with a test file. The
A `gdt.fixtures.JSONFixture` fixture is designed to evaluate JSONPath
expressions for the data defined in the fixture.

Assume I have a file `testdata/fixtures.json` that looks like this:

```json
{
    "books": [
        {
            "id": "12ac1b94-5667-461e-80cb-ba8619cae61a",
            "title": "Old Man and the Sea",
            "published_on": "1952-10-01",
            "pages": 127,
            "author": {
                "name": "Ernest Hemingway",
                "id": "1"
            },
            "publisher": {
                "name": "Charles Scribner's Sons",
                "id": "1",
                "address": {
                    "address": "153–157 Fifth Avenue",
                    "city": "New York City",
                    "state": "NY",
                    "postal_code": "10010",
                    "country_code": "US"
                }
            }
        }
    ],
    "authors": {
        "by_name": {
            "Ernest Hemingway": {
                "id": 1
            }
        }
    },
    "publishers": {
        "by_name": {
            "Charles Scribner's Sons": {
                "id": 1
            }
        }
    }
}
```

We can register a `gdt.fixtures.JSONFixture` that contains the data in
`testdata/fixtures.json`:

```go
	dataFilepath := "testdata/fixtures.json"

	dataFile, _ := os.Open(dataFilepath)
	dataFixture, err := gdt.NewJSONFixture(dataFile)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	gdt.RegisterFixture("books_data", dataFixture)
```

To reference any of the data in your `gdt.fixtures.JSONFixture` from your test
unit, just make sure the fixture is listed in the test file's `fixtures` field:

```
require:
 - books_data
```

Then you can grab any data in the fixture using a JSONPath expression in the
`data` contents:

```yaml
   data:
     author_id: $.authors.by_name["Ernest Hemingway"].id
```

### Specify expected response values (`assert.json.paths`)

When you want to validate the structure of the returned JSON object in an HTTP
response body, you use the `assert.json.paths` attribute of the test unit.

This attribute is a map of string to string, where the map keys are JSONPath
expressions and the map values are the expected value when evaluating that
JSONPath expression.

For example, let's say you want to verify that an HTTP `GET` request to the
`/books` URL returns an HTTP response that contains a list of JSON objects, and
that the first JSON object in that list contains a field, "title", that
contains the string "For Whom the Bell Tolls". You would write the test unit
like so:

```yaml
tests:
  - GET: /books
    assert:
      json:
        paths:
          - $[0].title: For Whom the Bell Tolls
```

### Specify expected response value format (`assert.json.path_formats`)

When you want to validate that a certain field in a returned JSON object from
an HTTP response matches a particular common format, you use the
`assert.json.path_formats` attribute of the test unit.

This attribute is a map of string to string, where the map keys are JSONPath
expressions and the map values are the [type of format](#valid-format-strings)
that the value to be found at the JSONPath expression should have.

For example, let's say you want to verify that an HTTP `GET` request to the
`/books/thebook` URL returned an HTTP response that contains a JSON object
having a "id" field, and that the value of that field is a valid version 4
UUID. You would write the test unit like so:

```yaml
tests:
  - GET: /books/thebook
    assert:
      json:
        path_formats:
          - $.id: uuid
```

The `$.id` string is a JSONPath expression that selects the value of the field
called "id" from the top-level document/object. The `uuid4` string indicates
the expected format of that value.

#### Valid format strings

The currently supported format strings are all format strings in Draft7 of
JSONSchema plus the "uuid4" variant:

* "date": must be a date string in the format YYYY-MM-DD
* "time": must be a time string in format HH:MM:SSZ-07:00 or HH:MM:SS
* "date-time": must be a date-time string in any of the following formats:

 * YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ-0700
 * YYYY-MM-DD
 * HH:MM:SSZ-0700
 * HH:MM:SS

* "hostname": must be a valid DNS hostname (RFC 952 and RFC 1123)
* "email": must be a valid email address (RFC 5322)
* "idn-email": must be a valid email address (RFC 5322)
* "ipv4": must be a valid IPv4 address (RFC 791)
* "ipv6": must be a valid IPv6 address (RFC 4291)
* "uri": must be a valid URI (RFC 3986)
* "uri-reference": must be a valid URI or relative-reference (RFC 3986)
* "iri": must be a valid URI (RFC 3986)
* "iri-reference": must be a valid URI or relative-reference (RFC 3986)
* "uri-template": must be a valid URI template (RFC 6570)
* "regex": must be a valid POSIX regular expression
* "json-pointer": must be a valid JSON pointer value
* "relative-json-pointer": must be a valid relative JSON pointer value
* "uuid": must be any version of UUID
* "uuid4": must be a UUID version 4

### `$$LOCATION`

The `url` attribute of an HTTP test spec can be the special string
`$$LOCATION`. When this is set, the HTTP request will be to the URL specified
in the *previous HTTP response's* Location HTTP header. This is an easy
shortcut for testing a series of ordered HTTP requests, where the first HTTP
request (typically a `POST` or `PUT` to a particular resource) responds with a
Location HTTP header pointing to a URL that can have issued an HTTP `GET`
request to return information about the previously created or mutated resource.

### Response assertions

Use the `assert` field in the Spec definition to tell `gdt-http` to assert
that various pieces of the HTTP response match expectations.

#### Checking for a string in response body

Use the `assert.strings` field to check for the existence of one of more
strings in the HTTP response body.

```yaml
fixtures:
 - books_api
tests:
 - name: invalid query parameter is supplied
   GET: /books?invalidparam=1
   assert:
     status: 400
     strings:
       - invalid parameter
```

#### Checking for an HTTP header

Use the `assert.headers` field to check for the existence of one of
more HTTP headers in the HTTP response.

```yaml
fixtures:
 - books_api
tests:
 - name: invalid query parameter is supplied
   GET: /books?invalidparam=1
   assert:
     status: 400
     headers:
       - Accept
```

TODO(jaypipes): Support Header value matching as well.

#### Checking for JSON in response

Use the `assert.json` field to assert that the value or format of a value of
an element identified by JSONPath expression matches an expected value or
format.

[`examples/books/tests/api/create_then_get.yaml`](../examples/books/tests/api/create_then_get.yaml):

```yaml
fixtures:
 - books_api
tests:
 - name: create a new book
   POST: /books
   data:
     title: For Whom The Bell Tolls
     published_on: 1940-10-21
     pages: 480
     author_id: $.authors.by_name["Ernest Hemingway"].id
     publisher_id: $.publishers.by_name["Charles Scribner's Sons"].id
   assert:
     status: 201
     headers:
      - Location
 - name: look up that created book
   GET: $$LOCATION
   assert:
     status: 200
     json:
       paths:
         $.author.name: Ernest Hemingway
         $.publisher.address.state: NY
       path_formats:
         $.id: uuid4
```

#### Validating an HTTP response to a JSONSchema

You can use the `assert.json.schema` field to specify a JSONSchema that the
HTTP response body should adhere to.

[`examples/books/tests/api/get_books.yaml`](../examples/books/tests/api/get_books.yaml):

```yaml
fixtures:
 - books_api
 - books_data
tests:
 - name: list all books
   GET: /books
   assert:
     status: 200
     json:
       schema: schemas/get_books.json
```

with the contents of [`examples/books/tests/api/schemas/get_books.json`](../examples/books/tests/api/schemas/get_books.json):

```json
{
  "$id": "/schemas/get_books.json",
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "books": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "id": {
            "type": "string"
          },
          "title": {
            "type": "string"
          },
          "pages": {
            "type": "number"
          },
          "author": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
              "id": {
                "type": "string"
              },
              "name": {
                "type": "string"
              }
            },
            "require": [ "id", "name" ]
          },
          "publisher": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
              "id": {
                "type": "string"
              },
              "name": {
                "type": "string"
              }
            },
            "require": [ "id", "name" ]
          }
        },
        "required": [ "id", "title", "author" ]
      }
    }
  },
  "required": [ "books" ]
}
```
